          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            Rexburg is a city in Madison County, Idaho, United States. The population was 25,484 at the 2010 census, up from 17,257 in 2000.[5] The city is the county seat of Madison County[6] and its largest city.[7] Rexburg is the principal city of the Rexburg, ID Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes Fremont and Madison Counties. The city is home to Brigham Young University-Idaho (BYU-Idaho), a private institution operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).
            The city takes its name from founder Thomas Edwin Ricks. The city was incorporated in 1883.[8]
            The Navy Electronics Laboratory oceanographic research ship USS Rexburg was named for the city.
            Rexburg was severely damaged by the Teton Dam Flood in June 1976. The Teton River flowed through northern Rexburg, and left most of the city underwater for several days after the Teton Dam ruptured. A museum dedicated to the Teton Dam Flood and the history of Rexburg and the area, located in the basement of the Rexburg Tabernacle, has been a major city landmark for decades.
            Rexburg has been the home of the Idaho International Dance Festival since 1986. During this time hundreds of teams from around the world have stayed with host families and shared ethnic dances and cultural experiences.
            When the Rexburg Idaho Temple was dedicated in 2008, Rexburg became the third city in Idaho with an LDS temple.
            The city gained attention after the disappearance and deaths of Tylee Ryan and J.J. Vallow, two siblings who went missing in September 2019 and were found dead in June 2020.

          <h2>Demographics</h2>
          <p>
            Rexburg is located at 43°49′N 111°47′W, at an elevation of 4,865 feet (1,483 m) above sea level.
            According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 9.84 square miles (25.49 km2), of which 9.76 square miles (25.28 km2) is land and 0.08 square miles (0.21 km2) is water.
            Much of the city, including BYU-Idaho and the LDS Church's Rexburg Idaho Temple, rests on top of a shield volcano just north of Rigby. Eruptions are not expected in the near future so far south; Yellowstone National Park and Island Park are thought to be the most likely settings for future volcanic activity in the area. Many different types of volcanoes exist near Rexburg,

          <p>
           There are cinder cones, spatter cones, other shield volcanoes, and volcanic fissures. There are lava fields to the west and south of Rexburg, the results of open fissure eruptions from about two thousand years ago. The nearby Craters of the Moon National Monument presents the most obvious features of this recent activity. Sediment deposits enriched by volcanism make the surrounding area famous for its production of large starch-rich potatoes.
           Rexburg is close to the St. Anthony Sand Dunes, the West Entrance of Yellowstone National Park and the Teton Range.
