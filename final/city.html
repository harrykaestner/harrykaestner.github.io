          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            The town was established in 1891 on the Onweiler farm north of the
            present site and was called Hunter. Two years later an I.O.O.F.
            lodge was organized and called itself Meridian because it was
            located on the Boise Meridian and the town was renamed. The
            Settlers' Irrigation Ditch, 1892, changed the arid region into a
            productive farming community which was incorporated in 1902.
