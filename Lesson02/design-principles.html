                <h3>Contrast</h3>
                  <h4>Pixlr</h4>
                  <a id="pixlr-site" href="https://pixlr.com/" target="_blank">pixlr.com</a>

                <p>This screenshot from Pixlr is an absolutely perfect example using <b>contrast</b> to improve design.
                    <p>The black background not only strongly contasts the white text contained within it, but it also
                    strongly contrasts the light blue background on the body of the page.</p>  
                    <p>The font choice of the header is bold in contrast to the thinner font
                    used for the paragraph text and the added orange pops as a complementary and 
                    therefore contrasting color to the blue.</p>

            <section class="sololearn-card">
                <h3>White Space</h3>
                <h4>SoloLearn</h4>
                <a id="sololearn-site" href="https://www.sololearn.com/" target="_blank">www.sololearn.com</a>
                <img src="images/sololearn-whitespace.png" alt="Example of SoloLearn's use of white space in website design" />
                <p>SoloLearn arranges its many icons and text in a way that leaves plenty of breathing room.</p>
                <p>Each language tutorial is cushioned inside a card with white space. In between the icon,
                   header, paragraph, and button there is an equal amount of white space; enough to separate 
                   the different items of the same card while still suggesting a relationship between them. 
                </p>
                <p>There is white space in the form of margins between each card and on the right
                    and left sides of each card.  
                </p>
            </section>
            <section class="target-card">
                <h3>Heirarchy</h3>
                <h4>Target</h4>
                <a id="target-site" href="https://www.target.com/" target="_blank">www.target.com</a>
                <img src="images/target-heirarchy.png" alt="Example of Target's use of heirachy in website design" />
                <p>The first thing you see on this page is the text displaying a 
                   "30% off" discount since it is the largest text on the page.</p> 
                   <p>Next your eyes are drawn to the next largest font that describes what it is you are getting 
                   your discount on: "women's clothing..." and then: "3 days only, ends Saturday". 
                </p>
                <p>Your eyes then move to the smaller text of the page and the highly contrasting buttons 
                   and navigation bar.
